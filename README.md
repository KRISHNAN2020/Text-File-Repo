Below are 10 API test cases for the POST endpoint /user/v1/self/accounts-receivables based on the provided acceptance criteria (AC1–AC9). These test cases focus on functional API verification, covering success scenarios, error conditions, and authentication-related checks. AC8 (logging in Splunk) and AC9 (UVM scans) are not directly included as they pertain to logging and security practices rather than functional API behavior. AC10 is excluded as it involves UI verification, which is outside the scope of API testing.For simplicity, I assume the request payload includes at least the OnBoardingURLRequired field, and user authentication is provided via a token in the request headers. The exact list of "required fields" is not specified in the requirements, so I will treat OnBoardingURLRequired as the primary field under test, with other fields implied as present and valid unless stated otherwise.Test Case 1: Successful Generation with iFrame URLDescription: Verify that a level 1 user providing all required fields with OnBoardingURLRequired set to '1' receives a 200 status code and a DMA integration token with an iFrame URL.Preconditions: User is authenticated as level 1, tenant is configured for AR, subscriber is active.Request:Method: POSTEndpoint: /user/v1/self/accounts-receivablesHeaders: Authorization: Bearer <valid_level_1_token>Payload: {"OnBoardingURLRequired": "1"}Steps:Send the POST request with the specified payload and headers.Expected Result:Status Code: 200Response Body: Contains a DMA integration token with an iframe_url field (e.g., {"token": "abc123", "iframe_url": "https://example.com/iframe"}).Test Case 2: Successful Generation without iFrame URLDescription: Verify that a level 1 user providing all required fields with OnBoardingURLRequired set to '0' receives a 200 status code and a DMA integration token without an iFrame URL.Preconditions: User is authenticated as level 1, tenant is configured for AR, subscriber is active.Request:Method: POSTEndpoint: /user/v1/self/accounts-receivablesHeaders: Authorization: Bearer <valid_level_1_token>Payload: {"OnBoardingURLRequired": "0"}Steps:Send the POST request with the specified payload and headers.Expected Result:Status Code: 200Response Body: Contains a DMA integration token without an iframe_url field (e.g., {"token": "abc123"}).Test Case 3: Validation Error - Missing Required FieldDescription: Verify that omitting the OnBoardingURLRequired field results in a 400 status code with a "Validation Error" message.Preconditions: User is authenticated as level 1.Request:Method: POSTEndpoint: /user/v1/self/accounts-receivablesHeaders: Authorization: Bearer <valid_level_1_token>Payload: {}Steps:Send the POST request with an empty payload.Expected Result:Status Code: 400Response Body: {"error": "Validation Error"}Test Case 4: Unauthorized - Level 2 UserDescription: Verify that a level 2 user attempting to generate the token receives a 401 status code with an "Unauthorize" message.Preconditions: User is authenticated as level 2.Request:Method: POSTEndpoint: /user/v1/self/accounts-receivablesHeaders: Authorization: Bearer <valid_level_2_token>Payload: {"OnBoardingURLRequired": "1"}Steps:Send the POST request with the specified payload and headers.Expected Result:Status Code: 401Response Body: {"error": "Unauthorize"}Test Case 5: Forbidden - Tenant Not ConfiguredDescription: Verify that a level 1 user receives a 403 status code with a "Forbidden" message when the tenant is not configured for the AR package.Preconditions: User is authenticated as level 1, tenant is not configured for AR.Request:Method: POSTEndpoint: /user/v1/self/accounts-receivablesHeaders: Authorization: Bearer <valid_level_1_token>Payload: {"OnBoardingURLRequired": "1"}Steps:Send the POST request with the specified payload and headers.Expected Result:Status Code: 403Response Body: {"error": "Forbidden"}Test Case 6: Not Found - Inactive SubscriberDescription: Verify that a level 1 user receives a 404 status code with a "Not Found" message when the subscriber is inactive.Preconditions: User is authenticated as level 1, subscriber is inactive.Request:Method: POSTEndpoint: /user/v1/self/accounts-receivablesHeaders: Authorization: Bearer <valid_level_1_token>Payload: {"OnBoardingURLRequired": "1"}Steps:Send the POST request with the specified payload and headers.Expected Result:Status Code: 404Response Body: {"error": "Not Found"}Test Case 7: Internal Server ErrorDescription: Verify that an environment issue or network failure results in a 500 status code with an "Internal Server Error" message.Preconditions: User is authenticated as level 1, simulate an environment or network failure (e.g., via mocking or fault injection).Request:Method: POSTEndpoint: /user/v1/self/accounts-receivablesHeaders: Authorization: Bearer <valid_level_1_token>Payload: {"OnBoardingURLRequired": "1"}Steps:Send the POST request under the simulated failure condition.Expected Result:Status Code: 500Response Body: {"error": "Internal Server Error"}Test Case 8: Invalid Authentication TokenDescription: Verify that an invalid authentication token results in a 401 status code.Preconditions: None.Request:Method: POSTEndpoint: /user/v1/self/accounts-receivablesHeaders: Authorization: Bearer <invalid_token>Payload: {"OnBoardingURLRequired": "1"}Steps:Send the POST request with an invalid token.Expected Result:Status Code: 401Response Body: Contains an error message (e.g., {"error": "Invalid Token"}), though not specified in AC; aligns with standard authentication failure.Test Case 9: Missing Authentication TokenDescription: Verify that omitting the authentication token results in a 401 status code.Preconditions: None.Request:Method: POSTEndpoint: /user/v1/self/accounts-receivablesHeaders: None (no Authorization header)Payload: {"OnBoardingURLRequired": "1"}Steps:Send the POST request without an authentication token.Expected Result:Status Code: 401Response Body: Contains an error message (e.g., {"error": "Authentication Required"}), though not specified in AC; aligns with standard authentication failure.Test Case 10: Validation Error - Invalid OnBoardingURLRequired ValueDescription: Verify that providing an invalid value for OnBoardingURLRequired (e.g., '2') results in a 400 status code with a "Validation Error" message.Preconditions: User is authenticated as level 1.Request:Method: POSTEndpoint: /user/v1/self/accounts-receivablesHeaders: Authorization: Bearer <valid_level_1_token>Payload: {"OnBoardingURLRequired": "2"}Steps:Send the POST request with the specified payload and headers.Expected Result:Status Code: 400Response Body: {"error": "Validation Error"}NotesAssumptions:The API requires an Authorization header with a bearer token to authenticate the user and determine their level.The request payload is in JSON format with Content-Type: application/json.Response bodies are in JSON format with an error field for error cases and token/iframe_url fields for success cases.OnBoardingURLRequired is a required field accepting only '0' or '1' as valid values.Coverage: These test cases cover AC1–AC7 directly and include additional authentication-related tests (8 and 9) to ensure robust API security, which is implicit in a user-level-based system. Test case 10 enhances validation coverage beyond a single missing field scenario.Limitations: Without the full API specification (e.g., exact required fields, response structure), some details are assumed. In practice, these test cases would be refined with precise field names and response formats from the API documentation.These 10 test cases provide comprehensive functional coverage for the /user/v1/self/accounts-receivables endpoint based on the given requirements.
